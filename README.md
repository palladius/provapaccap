Synopsis
========

This is my first test GAE+PHP. Anything goes, really.

OLD App Url: http://provapaccap.appspot.com/ (project was deleted..)
NEW App url: https://provapaccap-410016.ew.r.appspot.com/

* On 2024-01-02, tried to move to py3/php55 but failed miserably. Luckily, I left a Friction Log.
* On 2016-03-23, linked this to project "provapaccap" (pn 347062052652).

TODOs
-----

* P3. Move DB away from `/cloudsql/google.com:discoproject:provapaccap` into newly created local one.
* Use ID in Posts url rather than title itself (current is just a patch!)

Thanks
